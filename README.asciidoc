* Knowledge and experience in packaging software applications in formats like deb, rpm, lpp (AIX), AppImage and snap.
* Good knowledge of **electronics and circuitry** and deep knowledge and understanding of low-cost **3D printing**, with a popular open-source https://github.com/Patola/ebook[book] (in brazilian portuguese) published about it. Due to that, good modelling experience in open-source 3D modellers like Blender, FreeCAD and OpenSCAD.
* Knowledge and practice with **development boards** like ODROIDs from hardkernel, PCDuino, Orange and Banana Pi, Beaglebone Black, Wandboard, Cubieboard and many others.
* Additional knowledge about physics, chemistry, molecular biology and genetics, with a masters degree of genetics and molecular biology from one of Brazil's most respected universities.
* **Public speaker** in a number of http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.do?id=K4763932Z5[high-profile events and conferences], and also **youtube educator** with Maker/3DPrinting channels in https://www.youtube.com/makerlinux[brazilian portuguese] and https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC65ISAck97KwTJRlFHEvTOg[english].

[[objective]]
==== Objective
* Mostly due to my diverse set of abilities, my best performance is at **medium to long term projects with high stakes** and responsibilities and unforeseen circumstances.
* I thrive at **complex systems environments** with multiple languages, being able to learn a new one in a very short time. High skill in troubleshooting and fixing system problems and keep things working even in emergencies.
* With my education experience, I am also very good and **documenting and organizing** computing environments.
* I can administrate diverse **UNIX system environments** including planning for high availability (certified in HACMP for AIX and with experience in other HA systems) and network topology and firewalls.
* I can **code applications** that complement a diverse environment, with scripting, VM-based or compiled languages.
* I can advise on open-source licensing and strategies.
* I can use my extra skills to complement work, e.g. 3D printing for embedded devices or 3D modelling.
* I can work night shift if needed. Had a 5 years period at IBM with that.

[[education]]
==== Education
* State University of Campinas (Unicamp), 2001. Computer engineering.
* State University of Campinas (Unicamp), 2010. Master in Genetics and Molecular Biology.
* Several certifications from Unixes:
** SAIR Linux certification, 2001
** CATE (Certified Advanced Techical Expert) for AIX, 2001.
** HP-UX and Solaris System Administrator certifications.
* Many in-job courses and certifications, from *ITILv3* to individual products like Lotus Notes and Maximo.
* Embedded development courses with __Embedded Labworks__ and (now extinct) __Techtraining__.

[[experience]]

* *Solvo* S/A, 1998-2001: Unix systems administrator, 2001-2002: Unix Application Developer.
* *YMF* S/A, 2002-2003: J2EE developer for financial systems.
* **Convergys, Inc.**, 2003-2005: Unix and Windows applications developer (front-end and backend)
* **IBM Brasil S/A**, 2005-2016: UNIX Systems administrator, Unix Team Lead, Unix Application Developer.

[[languages]]

[[availability]]
==== Availability
* **Travel Availability**: Available for both national and international trips with up to 6 months periods.
* ** Work Availability**: Available to work half-time, full-time, home-office and also with contracts due to having a small business to perform computer-related services.

[[caveats]]
==== Caveats and shortcomings
* Due to the necessary rich and complex environments and toolsets needed for my kind of work, I found it impractical, maybe impossible, to work in a Windows desktop, even a Windows 10 desktop with Windows Subsystem for Linux. A proper updated real Linux desktop is needed, be it RedHat, Ubuntu, Arch or any derivatives, but since most Linux desktops are free of charge, this usually does not pose a monetary problem.
